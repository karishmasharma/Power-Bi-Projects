# Data Cleaning with Power BI

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning using Power BI. The goal was to prepare raw datasets for analysis by applying various cleaning techniques, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the data.

Steps Performed

➡️ Removing Unwanted Columns: Eliminated unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

➡️ Checking Data Types: Verified and corrected data types for consistency.

➡️ Removing Duplicate Rows: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

➡️ Merging Columns: Combined two columns into one for better data representation.

➡️ Splitting Columns: Separated data in a single column into two where appropriate.

➡️ Renaming Columns: Renamed columns for clarity and readability.

➡️ Handling Null Values: Dealt with missing data by filling, replacing, or removing them as necessary.

➡️ Replacing Values: Replaced incorrect or outdated values to maintain data quality.

➡️ Formatting: Applied consistent formatting for improved presentation and usability.
