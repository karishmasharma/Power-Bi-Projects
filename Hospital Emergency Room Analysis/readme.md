# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI Dashboard that provides insights into Hospital  Emergency Room (ER) operations, helping stakeholders analyze patient trends, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and optimize hospital resource allocation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is designed to help healthcare administrators and decision-makers understand emergency room performance through interactive visualizations and data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Key Features
* Number of Patients: Tracks total ER visits daily with trend analysis.
* Average Wait Time: Analyzes patient wait times before being attended to.
* Patient Satisfaction Score: Evaluates service quality through daily satisfaction trends.
* Patient Referrals: Monitors ER patient referrals to other departments.
* Demographic Analysis: Breakdown by age, gender, and race to understand patient distribution.
  
## 📊 Dashboards Developed
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard includes four key dashboards, each serving a specific purpose to analyze hospital emergency room performance efficiently.

### 1️⃣ Monthly View Dashboard
Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

Key Visuals:

* Patient Admission Status: Tracks admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
* Patient Age Distribution: Groups patients into 10-year age intervals.
* Department Referrals: Shows referral trends across different hospital departments.
* Timeliness: Measures the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
* Gender Analysis: Displays the gender distribution of patients.
* Racial Demographics: Analyzes patient demographics by race.
* Time Analysis: Tracks patient volume by day and hour.
