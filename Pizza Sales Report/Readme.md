# 🍕 Pizza Sales Report Dashboard - Power BI

📌 Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize pizza sales data using Power BI. It provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and various sales trends to help improve business decision-making.

The SQL queries for extracting and processing data have already been completed and uploaded in the  My SQL Repository. This repository focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard based on that processed data.

🎯 Key Objectives

The dashboard will help to:
✅ Track total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold
✅ Monitor daily and monthly sales trends
✅ Analyze sales distribution by pizza category and size
✅ Identify top-selling and least-selling pizzas

📊 KPIs Included

The following key indicators are calculated:

Total Revenue: Sum of all pizza order prices
Average Order Value: Total revenue / total number of orders
Total Pizzas Sold: Total quantity of all pizzas sold
Total Orders: Total number of orders placed
Average Pizzas Per Order: Total pizzas sold / total orders
📈 Charts & Visuals
