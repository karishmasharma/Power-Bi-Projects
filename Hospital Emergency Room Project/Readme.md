# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard - Power BI Project
Overview

This project involves the creation of a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into the performance of a hospital's emergency room (ER) by tracking key metrics such as patient volume, wait times, patient satisfaction, and department referrals. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care through data-driven decision-making.

## Project Steps   

⬇️ Requirement Gathering / Business Requirements:Understanding the key metrics and business needs for the ER dashboard.

⬇️ Data Walkthrough: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and content.

⬇️ Data Connection: Connecting to the data source in Power BI.

⬇️  Cleaning / Quality Check: Ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.

⬇️ Data Modeling: Creating relationships between different data tables.

⬇️ Data Processing: Transforming and preparing the data for visualization.

⬇️ DAX Calculations: Writing DAX formulas to calculate key metrics.

⬇️ Dashboard Layouting: Designing the layout of the dashboard.

⬇️  Development and Formatting: Creating and formatting charts to visualize the data.

⬇️ Dashboard / Report Development: Building the final dashboard with interactive elements.

⬇️  Generation: Analyzing the data to generate actionable insights.

## Dashboards

The project includes four dashboards:

### 1. Monthly View

Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
Charts:
Patient Admission Status (Admitted vs. Non-Admitted)
Patient Age Distribution (Grouped by 10-year intervals)
Department Referrals (Trends across different departments)
Timeliness (Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes)
Gender Analysis (Patient distribution by gender)
Racial Demographics (Patient data by race)
Time Analysis (Patient volume by day and hour)

### 2. Consolidated View

Objective: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.
Charts: Similar to the Monthly View, but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis.

### 3. Patient Details

Objective: Offer granular insights into patient-level data for detailed analysis and troubleshooting.
Charts:
A grid displaying essential fields:
Patient ID
Patient Full Name
Gender
Age
Admission Date
Patient Race
Wait Time
Department Referral
Admission Status

### 4. Key Takeaways

Objective: Summarize findings from all dashboards to provide clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.
Charts: Descriptive analysis of each metric, including patterns, anomalies, and recommendations to optimize ER operations and patient care.
Key Metrics Tracked

Number of Patients: Total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
Average Wait Time: Average time patients wait before being attended to by a medical professional.
Patient Satisfaction Score: Average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis.
Number of Patients Referred: Number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.
Business Requirements

The dashboard is designed to meet the following business requirements:

Track and analyze the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
Monitor average wait times and identify days with higher wait times.
Evaluate patient satisfaction scores to identify dips in satisfaction.
Track the number of patients referred to specific departments and identify departments with high referral rates.
Tools Used

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures.
Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation.
